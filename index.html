			<h3><strong>Gaming :</strong></h3>          <button class="button">poof</button>
			<p>I am a huge gamer and have over 7000 hours spent on various games , i enjoy Team fortress 2 and have played in tournaments and contributed to community events, as well as csgo and R6 in wich i reached very high skill ranks.
			I have spent alot of time trading virtual items in TF2 and CSGO for real money via different websites and community servers which allowed me to convert virtual currency into real money on paypal. This is probably the reason why im studying marketing. </p>
